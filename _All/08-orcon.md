Orcon was one of my semester-long independent game development projects. The player is a pigeon-pilot based loosely on the actual research of BF Skinner during WWII, who successfully trained pigeons to pilot ordinance with a 100% hit rate. The graphics are stylized to reflect the modernist aircraft design sentiment of the 60's (for example MiG-21 Russian fighter jets). The gameplay is very fast paced and difficult, dodging oncoming fire enroute to a high value air-borne target. Download it on [gamejolt.](https://gamejolt.com/games/orcon/304008)
