<p>My latest work has been the Senior Technical Artist for <a href="https://www.realize.design/" target="_blank">Realize.design</a>. This iOS interior design app enables users to find what fits in their room using photogrammetry, AI, and user-first UI. I was responsible for the pre-production mockups of the app, the creation of the asset pipeline, and the development of some cutting-edge features around cloud-based 3D model loading and material switching. Lately, I've been responsible for gathering product data and keeping it up to date for the checkout system. To date, I have implemented over four thousand high-quality 3D models, optimized for mobile.</p>
<p>Realize works similar to the shopping and building modes of The Sims but instead, we use real products from popular retailers such as Crate&Barrel, Target, Wayfair, and IKEA. These are all purchasable in a one-checkout system including sizable discounts for users.</p>
