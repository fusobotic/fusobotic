<p>My latest work has been the Lead Technical Artist for Realize.design, an iOS interior design app that enables users find what fits in their room using photogrammetry, AI and user-first UI. I was responsible for the pre-production mockups of the app, the creation of the asset pipeline and the development of some cutting edge features around cloud-based 3D model loading and material switching. Lately I've been responsible for gathering product data and keeping it up to date for the checkout system. To date I have implemented over four thousand high-quality 3D models, optimized for mobile.</p>
<p>Realize works similar to the shopping and building modes of The Sims but instead we use real products from popular retailers such as Crate&Barrel, Target, Wayfair, and IKEA. These are all purchasable in a one-checkout system including sizable discounts for users.</p>
