Another Illustrator related project, this time we were tasked with tracing a picture of one sort of bug or another. I decided to go in a different direction and make it slightly cartoon (to take advantage of Illustrators strengths). This one is very dapper jumping spider with a top hat and the illusion of a mustache.
