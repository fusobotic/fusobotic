This is what I consider to be my most vast illustration. I spent over a month developing a unique concept, researching, prototyping designs, getting feedback and polishing. You can check out the [entire process](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?305243-Projekt-Valour) if you’d like.

A global robotic’s CG competition prompted me to pour as much effort as I could into it. This carried me to second place in the competition and a feature on Polycount, Blenderatists, and a CG news website.

And before you ask, I used the German spelling for the project name to distinguish it in SEO.
