A character I modeled from scratch according to a collection of photo references given to me by a client. This was the first step in the pipeline before I handed it off to some texture artists and riggers.

It was the first time I got to have custom reference shots collected as part of a job and it yielded very pleasing results. I also learned a lot about anatomy and skin texture while sculpting it.
