**When I was twelve, I decided to enter the industry.**

I got my first paycheck at thirteen. From there I worked my 10k hours on personal and professional projects. Every client, colleague and professor I’ve collaborated with has noted my exceptional attention to detail but also my overall organization and clarity. My aim is to work with those who care deeply about their field and know exactly how I can contribute. Recently I’ve done mostly contract work but I’m always looking for a more permanent workplace to settle in.
