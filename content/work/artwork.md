![Daylight Picture of Dollywod Tree](/images/tree1.jpg) *Working at LifeFormations I was given the responsibility of collaborating with Dollywood’s creative director to generate a dozen concepts and the final version of their 55ft Wildwood Tree. It is the centerpiece of Wildwood Grove, Dollywood’s newest expansion. After concepting I populated all 600 programmable LED butterflies and 1200 leaves in various configurations, making wiring diagrams along the way. Once the design was finalized I assisted in splitting the tree into chunks for milling, casting, shipping and assembly.*
