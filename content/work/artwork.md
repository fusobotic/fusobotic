### BMW E30 M3 1996
*This is a redesign of my favorite sports car the E30 M3 EVO. I took some liberties modifying aspects of the shapes and proportions to suit my taste in hard surface modeling. Namely the front grill terminates directly into the bumper without a chassis border on the bottom, the front hood has a straight cut across the top of the kidney grills, the turn signal lights on the side of the car are deleted (BMW drivers don't need them), the trunk hatch has a more flush transition into the tail lights, some unnecessary panel lines are filled in and there is an additional muffler.*

*It was primarily modeled for use with SLA resin 3D printing using a new, highly-destructive workflow I developed. I start with subdivison modeling of the car body, then move the buck into ZBrush for booleans. Before exporting from ZBrush I use smooth and polish brushes to correct surface artifacts from poly modeling and create features that would normally not be possible to replicate with normal modeling (without ruining adjacent curves and surfaces on the car). I then split the model for printing with holes and posts for wheel bearings carved for press-fitting. I was still able to use the model for rendering given how high the poly count was and how smooth the surfaces had to be for SLA resin printing.*

### Humane Interface
*This was a university project for modeling and rendering. I used a concept from Gui Guimaraes as inspiration in which he personifies the different video game consoles. This one is meant to represent the Playstation 4. I used ZBrush, Blender and Photoshop*

### Book Cover Illustrations
A pair of illustrations done for Cambridge University Press commissioned by Douglas E. Stevens PhD. They portray the bookâ€™s contents and themes in the form of Adam Smith on the top fold and a modernized steam engine on the bottom. I used Procreate and Photoshop to paint these and combined them to make the cover in Illustrator.

### Projekt Valour
This piece was a rendered illustration I created for a CG Cookie robotics-themed contest. It won second place and made it onto some news websites and was featured by the Polycount and Blenderartists CG-forums. It was an original concept meant to evoke the work of the painter Ashely Wood.
