### Realize

![Demo of Realize App](/images/gifs/realize_demo.gif) 

*On [Realize](https://www.realize.design/) I was the Senior Technical Artist. We developed and maintained the app in Unity on iOS and Android over 4 years and were able to reach #2 in Lifestyle Apps on the App Store with over 700,000 users. I was in charge of the look of the app in pre-production as a contractor, managed the asset catalogue as Lead Technical Artist at release, and am now a Senior Technical Artist responsible for backend APIs and managing all the meta data of furniture that appears in the app.*

*We have over 400,000 unique products and I designed 100 unique furniture bundles made for AI room designing in the app. I was also responsible for the Python-based price checking and Stripe checkout APIs which enabled users to buy new furniture in a unified checkout system. We made thousands of dollars of revenue from both subscriptions and in-app furniture purchases.*

### Brukel

I was the Lead 3D Artist on [Brukel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1073900/Brukel/) but also shaped the pipeline for the character, environment and prop art. The game is a historical horror game where you investigate the remnants of a real  house that was located in Belgium during World War II. The house transforms as you uncover new memories of the original residents and occupiers. I was responsible for making sure that the game was able to run on PC smoothly while maintaining as much fidelity as possible based on real photographs of the actual location. It won four different game awards and was featured by the Smithsonian Arcade in 2019.

### Orcon
Orcon was a project I developed in Unreal Engine on my own as part of a class at Miami University. It has a basis in the real experiments of BF Skinner who was able to train pigeons to pilot missiles before other missile guidance were invented. I was responsible for every aspect of the game.
