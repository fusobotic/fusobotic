## Christian Coppoletti



![Picture of me](/images/bio.jpg) I am a husband, dad, and technical artist with backgrounds in  industrial and game design. I use my experience with programming to enhance workflows and develop new software. I have been working professionally in the space since 2009 and have collaborated with a range of companies from Disney, and GE to smaller startups in Cincinnati and Chicago. I love creating plugins to minimize busywork and enhance creativity. I also like to develop small pragmatic solutions to large problems.
