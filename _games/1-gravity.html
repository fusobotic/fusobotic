<p>This game was made over the course of a semester with the help of some friends. I handled all of the programming, level construction and animation. I had some help with aesthetic, sound and level design.</p>
<p>It went on to win our team Best Digital Game at AGF 2015. It has also been featured on the <a href="http://www.aimsgamescenter.com/2015/06/gravity/" target="_blank">AIMS homepage</a> and <a href="http://miamioh.edu/news/top-stories/2016/03/game-design.html" target="_blank">Miami Universityâ€™s official blog</a>. It features a simple click-based mechanic that is made increasingly complex through new obstacles and challenges.</p>
