<p>This was a small game coded by myself in Unity 3D in 48 hours. The game jam theme was public transportation, so I decided to make transit for lost cosmonauts.</p>
<p>Thanks to Meg Linard for some of the 2D art.</p>
<p>Controls: Arrow keys, pick up the cosmonaut animals on the side of your ship. Drop them off for more fuel.</p>
