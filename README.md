__Jekyll Portfolio Site__

**Building:**

Gotta have Node.js, Ruby, Jekyll and other dependencies installed to build and run the server locally. Easier to get running on Mac than on PC I've learned.

**Modding:**

Just modify the sections, the categories and the .md/.html files to suit your needs. Do any new stuff in the custom.sass file, and remember to append any new .scss/.sass files in the main.scss. Other than that, just know how to use Jekyll.

Thanks to [shakeyShane](https://github.com/shakyShane) for the awesome starter repo. Gulp+Jekyll is a match made in heaven :kissing_heart: Also shoutout to [Travis Neilson](https://github.com/travisneilson) for all the sick Jekyll info :sunglasses:
