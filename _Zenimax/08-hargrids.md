Working at LifeFormations I helped design and produce two figures for Hagridâ€™s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure in Universal Orlando's Island of Adventure. One was a static Centaur with a bow and the other was a full scale cerberus named Fluffy with three moving, growling heads. The rollercoaster has gone on to win the 2019 Themed Entertainment Association Outstanding Achievement Award and continues to be their most popular ride.
