<p>Probably one of the more complex game models I've created, this Desert Eagle was modeled down the the bolt, magazine and bullet. It was meant for use in an unreleased survival first person shooter. I also modeled a pair of hands and a knife with matching rigs for animation. I've included an animated gif to illustrate a proposed set of actions in-engine. I also created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s602i8uNXEA&list=PLZwhM7x9sfvua6NXRZBW9FkRXPw-W6A5S" target="_blank">series of videos</a> covering the workflow for these models.</p>
