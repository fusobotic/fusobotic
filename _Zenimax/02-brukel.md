These are screenshots of an upcoming 1940s-era game I'm working as a Lead 3D Artist. I constructed the pipeline for character art, level meshes, and smaller props in Unreal Engine 4, but also oversaw quality assurance checks. These are some assets that I created on my own. In addition I helped other artists with their assets, touched up art and shared some techniques with colleagues.
