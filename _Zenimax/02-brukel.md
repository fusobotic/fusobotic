These are development shots of [Brukel](https://www.brukelgame.com/){:target="_blank"}, a game I worked as a Lead 3D Artist. I constructed the pipeline for character art, level meshes, and smaller props in Unreal Engine 4, but also oversaw quality assurance checks. These are some assets that I created on my own. In addition I helped other artists with their assets, touched up art and shared techniques.
