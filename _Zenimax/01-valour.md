This is what I consider to be my most vast illustration. I spent over a month developing a unique concept, researching, prototyping designs, getting feedback and polishing. You can check out the [entire process](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?305243-Projekt-Valour){:target="_blank"} if youâ€™d like.

A global robotics CG competition prompted me to pour as much effort as I could into it. This carried me to second place in the competition and a feature on Polycount, Blenderatists, and a CG news website.
