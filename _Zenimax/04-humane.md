Something inspired by a childhood dream of mine and this amazing [concept](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8wDbG){:target="_blank"} by Gui Guimaraes. I had some time on my hands to create something a little over the top for a 3D class final.

It's basically a personification of the Play Station 4 operating system.
