A small game environment art project inspired by some of the sharp concept designs behind the movie The Prince of Egypt. The main focal point is a Sycamore Fig which is indigenous to the region and quite twisted in its trunk and limbs. Both screenshots rendered in Unreal Engine 4. Texturing done with Substance Painter.
