These images were part of a presentation my team gave during E3 2016. The month-long project was the result of a 48 hour Social Connection gamejam hosted by the ESA and AARP. We made it all the way to the finals and presented at the Ritz Carleton in LA. The concept is mostly about exploration and co-operative puzzle solving, but also focuses on passive world-creation by players.
